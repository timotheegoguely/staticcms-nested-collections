[Nested collections](https://next.staticcms.org/docs/migration-guide-v2#nested-collections) is a beta feature that allows a folder collection to show a nested structure of entries and edit the locations of the entries. This feature is useful when you have a complex folder structure and may not want to create separate collections for every directory. As it is in beta, please use with discretion.
